shell-config
============
This is just a place to keep my shell configuration, .emacs file and similar things.

The emacs config uses elpa for package management so there is realy nothing interesting there.

To use it with emacs you need to symlink .emacs and .emacs.d from root to here.
 
You are free to use this, with no warranty, as you see fit.
